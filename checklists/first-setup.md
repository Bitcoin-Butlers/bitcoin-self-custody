# First Setup Checklist

Just got a signing device or hardware wallet? Follow this checklist before sending any real Bitcoin to it.

## Before You Start

- [ ] Read the guide for your specific device in `/guides/`
- [ ] Make sure you have a steel backup plate (not paper)
- [ ] Find a private space, no cameras, no one looking over your shoulder
- [ ] Close unnecessary apps on your computer
- [ ] Disconnect from any screen-sharing or remote desktop software

## Unboxing

- [ ] Check tamper-evident packaging (bag, seal, holographic sticker, depending on device)
- [ ] Verify the device looks factory-new, no scratches, no signs of use
- [ ] If anything looks opened or tampered with, **do not use it**, contact the manufacturer

## Firmware

- [ ] Update to the latest firmware before generating any keys
- [ ] Verify the firmware signature if your device supports it (ColdCard, Passport)
- [ ] Note the firmware version for your records

## Seed Generation

- [ ] Generate your seed phrase (12 or 24 words)
- [ ] **Option A:** Let the device generate it (easier, trust the device's RNG)
- [ ] **Option B:** Generate your own entropy (dice, Seed Picker cards, camera entropy on SeedSigner)
- [ ] Write the words on your steel backup plate, **not paper**
- [ ] Double-check every word, letter by letter
- [ ] Set a PIN or passphrase if your device supports it

## Verify Your Backup

This is the most important step. Do not skip it.

- [ ] Wipe the device (or use the "verify backup" feature if available)
- [ ] Restore from your steel backup
- [ ] Confirm the same addresses appear in your wallet software
- [ ] If addresses don't match, something went wrong. Start over.

## First Transaction

- [ ] Send a small test amount (enough to not lose, small enough to not panic)
- [ ] Verify the transaction arrived in your wallet software
- [ ] Send it back or to another address you control
- [ ] Confirm the device signs correctly and the transaction broadcasts

## Storage

- [ ] Store your steel backup in a physically secure location (safe, safety deposit box)
- [ ] Consider geographic separation: device in one location, backup in another
- [ ] If using a passphrase, store it separately from the seed words
- [ ] Document where things are stored (for inheritance, not on the device itself)

## You're Done

Your Bitcoin is now in self-custody. No exchange, no company, no third party can freeze, seize, or lose your funds.
