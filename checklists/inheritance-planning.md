# Inheritance Planning Checklist

Bitcoin doesn't care if you die. Without a plan, your family gets nothing.

This checklist is non-technical. It's about decisions, not devices.

## The Hard Questions

Answer these before touching any technology:

- [ ] Who should receive your Bitcoin if something happens to you?
- [ ] Do they know Bitcoin exists? (They need to, eventually)
- [ ] Do they know how to use it, or will they need help?
- [ ] Do you trust them not to be coerced into accessing it early?
- [ ] Is there a legal framework (will, trust) that covers digital assets?

## What Your Heir Needs to Know

At minimum, your heir needs access to:

- [ ] The fact that Bitcoin exists and roughly how much
- [ ] Where the signing device is stored
- [ ] Where the seed backup is stored (separate from the device)
- [ ] The passphrase, if you use one (stored separately from the seed)
- [ ] Which wallet software to use and how to connect
- [ ] A trusted person to call for help (a Butler, a technical friend)

## What Your Heir Does NOT Need Right Now

- Access to spend your Bitcoin while you're alive
- Your PIN or device password
- Real-time knowledge of your exact balance

## Storage Strategy

The goal: your heir can reconstruct access, but no single person or location has everything needed to spend.

- [ ] Seed words: stored on steel, in a secure physical location
- [ ] Passphrase: stored separately from seed words (different location or person)
- [ ] Device: stored in a third location (or with the seed, PIN-protected)
- [ ] Instructions: a sealed letter explaining what's where and what to do
- [ ] Trusted contact: someone technical who can help your heir, without having spending access themselves

## Legal Considerations

- [ ] Does your will mention digital assets? (It should)
- [ ] Does your estate attorney understand Bitcoin custody? (Most don't)
- [ ] Is your Bitcoin held in a way that your estate can legally access it?
- [ ] Have you considered a trust for larger amounts?

## Multisig for Inheritance

For larger amounts, multisig (2-of-3 or 3-of-5) can distribute trust:

- [ ] Key 1: You hold (primary access)
- [ ] Key 2: Heir holds (or sealed in a safe)
- [ ] Key 3: Trusted third party (attorney, Butler, family member)
- [ ] No single party can spend alone
- [ ] Any two parties can reconstruct access

## Test It

- [ ] Walk through the process with your heir (or a trusted proxy) on testnet
- [ ] Verify they can physically access the backup locations
- [ ] Verify the instructions are clear enough for a non-technical person
- [ ] Update the plan when anything changes (new device, new passphrase, moved backup)

## Review Schedule

- [ ] Review annually
- [ ] Review after any major life event (marriage, divorce, birth, death, move)
- [ ] Review after any change to your custody setup
