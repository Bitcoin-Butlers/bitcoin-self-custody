# Hardware Wallet Emulators

**Status: Planned**

Web-based practice environments for Bitcoin hardware wallets. Practice device setup, seed generation, and transaction signing without owning the hardware.

## Vision

- Browser-based, no installation required
- Realistic UI that mirrors the actual device experience
- Testnet only, never touches real funds
- Follows the same step-by-step flow as our written guides

## Planned Emulators

- [ ] SeedSigner (stateless, good starting point)
- [ ] ColdCard Mk4 / Q
- [ ] Passport
- [ ] Jade / Jade Plus

## Contributing

If you're interested in building emulators, open an issue to discuss the approach. We're looking for contributors with experience in:

- Hardware wallet firmware (any device)
- Web-based UI simulation
- Bitcoin transaction construction (PSBTs)
- Testnet integration

## Why This Matters

Most people buy a hardware wallet and are immediately confronted with unfamiliar screens and decisions. A practice environment lets them build confidence before touching real money.
